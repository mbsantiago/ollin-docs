Contribution can be done in different fronts. In what follows we specify guidelines and procedures
to contribute to Ollin for each type of contribution.


General Contribution Procedure
==============================

To contribute to Ollin, please fork the repository_ in GitHub, modify your fork

maintainers with your contribution suggestions and code, although we generally
prefer using the GitHub channel. Check this guide_ on how to make pull requests.

Model Contribution
==================

With Ollin, we wish to provide a unified package and platform for analysis of
motion and its relations to occupancy and home range. To this end we designed
Ollin to make it relatively easy to contribute to an ever growing
library of movement and estimation models. If you wish to to add you models to
Ollin, please select the corresponding section.

.. toctree::
  movement_model
  estimation

Although code contribution requires some knowledge of python, we
encourage those without the technical background to reach out to the maintainers
with your ideas for new models.

Documentation Contribution
==========================

The documentation for Ollin is in its infancy and we wish to keep improving it.
You can help us modifying the docstrings in the code base, or editing the
documentation files.

The documentation files are contained in the ``docs/`` directory of the code
base. They are written in reStructuredText_ and are built with sphinx_.

For docstrings we follow the ``numpydoc`` style, so please check this_ guide
on writing documentation.
